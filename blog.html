                     <p> Today is a big day. It is the first day of the month and the first day of the rest of my life.<br>
                     I woke up at 6:30 am, nice and early. I then got some cereal with milk. After that I headed off to school. <br>
                      At school I learned math, science, language arts, and History. I also worked on this website some more which was really fun.<br>
                      We had pizza at lunch and then it was the end of the school day.</p>
