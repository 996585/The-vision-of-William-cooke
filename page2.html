                 <h2>Soccer </h2>
                 <p>My favorite thing to do in my free time is play soccer. I play as a fullback/winger mainly on my club team but enjoy playing all posistions <br>.
                 My favorite club team is Borussia Dortmund which is a team based out of the city of Dortmund in Germany.<br>
                I enjoy soccer because it kind of makes me feel in control and I enjoy hanging out with the many friends I have met through playing.</p>
                 
                 <h2> Videogames </h2>

                 <p> If I am not playing soccer I also enjoy playing videogames.<br>
                      I enjoy playing MOBA's (Multiplayer online battle arena), sports games, and occasionally rpgs. My favorite videogames are League of Legends And Fifa.<br> 
                      I enjoy League of Legends because I enjoy competition and it also is something I can play with many of my friends when we are not toghether. <br>
                     I enjoy Fifa because I really like soccer so I kind of like to immerse myself in the sport even if its virtual.</p>

                 <p> So you may ask, what does William do if he is not reading or playing videogames? <br> 
                   Well, I read. I enjoy pretty much all genres. From Dystopian, to nonfiction, to historical fiction. Basically I just enjoy reading.<br>
                  My favorite book of all time is 1984 because George orewell was able to combine facisim and communisim in one goverment and kind made fun of Hitler and Stallin in his own way.<br>
                 The book also still has meaning with real life with all of the fake news and misleading information we are faced with today.<br>
                 The most recent book I have read is Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. <br>
                 I don't think it has that much meaning today, but I really enjoyed reading the book and ending was absoulutley amazing.
