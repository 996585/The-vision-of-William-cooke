   <h2> Analysis </h2>
  <p>Through analyzing the data we have collected we have noticed two things.<br>
   The first thing we have noticed is that over the years poverty has decreased for all races, although hispanic people are expieriencing a rise in poverty.<br>
   The second thing we have noticed is that the poverty rate has always been highest for blacks and hispanics, and lowest for asians and whites.<br>
This shows that people growing up in poverty are more likely to be in poverty themselves.<p>
