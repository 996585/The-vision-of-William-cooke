   <h2> Analysis </h2>
  <p>Through analyzing the data we have collected we have noticed two things.<br>
   The firat graph shows that over the years poverty has decreased for all races, although hispanic people are expieriencing a rise in poverty.<br>
   The second graphthat the poverty rate is highest for blacks and hispanics, and lowest for asians and whites.<br>
     We chose to repersent the second graph in a pie chart to show proportionally how the races compare in terms of poverty rate.<br>
          This shows that people growing up in poverty are more likely to be in poverty themselves. </p>
   
   <h2> conclusion </h2>
    <p> Throughout this progject, we have learned many things. We have learned about how race affects how much money you make,<br>
       and how to chose how to display data. We discovered that line graphs are usually best when their is a time component, and pie charts when its proportional.<br>
        We have also learned through researching  are topic the school to prison pipeline and have realized how lucky we are to go to a school like minnetonka.
